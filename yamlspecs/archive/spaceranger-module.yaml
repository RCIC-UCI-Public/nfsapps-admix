  description: |
    Space Ranger {{version}} is a set of analysis pipelines that process Visium spatial 
    RNA-seq output and brightfield and fluorescence microscope images in order to detect
    tissue, align reads, generate feature-spot matrices, perform clustering and gene 
    expression analysis, and place spots in spatial context on the slide image. Space 
    Ranger includes pipelines relevant to spatial gene expression experiments. See
