Licensing info  2021-01-27 
-----------------------------
Per communicatino with N. Crawford and MJ Qomi:

Software access is restrictred to the users in 'gaussian' group. 
The license has been bought by the school of physical sciences and the
license manager in the school of physical sciences is Nathan Crawford,
The license handler in the school of engineering is Mohammad Javad Abdolhosseini Qomi.
For authorization please email one of them (based on user's department
affiliation) to ask to be added to the group. 

One of the Gaussian licensing restrictions is to have a nondisclosure agreement
signed. Any user who asks to be added to gaussian group must sign a form, provide it
to Nathan Crawford, who then mails the physical copies to Gaussian. The agreement is basically
to prevent sharing Gaussian results and timings with the Furche group (Turbomole developers)

Form will be added  to the licenses repo.
