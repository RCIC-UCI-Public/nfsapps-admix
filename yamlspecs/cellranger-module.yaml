    CellRanger is a set of analysis pipelines. It can process Chromium
    single-cell RNA-seq output to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices
    and perform clustering and gene expression analysis. Cell Ranger includes four
    pipelines relevant to single-cell gene expression experiments. See documentation
