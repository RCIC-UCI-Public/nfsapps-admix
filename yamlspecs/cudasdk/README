The above is an interative script tht asks the following
- Please choose install option: 1 
  this is a menu item for Single system install
- Installation directory? [/opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk] /data/opt/apps/nvidia/hpc_sdk
  Takes forefer to install .... about 2hrs
- Please choose an option [1-3]: 3
  this is a menu item for cuda 10.1 which is what we have with cuda-admix

The intall creates  a distribution of copied files in the chosen directory
that are linked to 10.1 cuda version in it. Additional available are 10.2 and 11.0.
There are 2 files in /data/opt/apps/nvidia/hpc_sdk/Linux_x86_64/20.7/compilers/bin/
that are created by install based on cuda default version and supported gcc compiler:
- cudarc
- localrc

Based on /data/opt/apps/nvidia/hpc_sdk/modulefiles/ created by the install process
create proper modules in nfsapps-admix
