# Template Slurm Script turbomole7.5.slurm.template

To prepare a customized slurm script, copy the template into
a separate file, and edit the file to set queue variables and
calls to relevant TURBOMOLE programs.  Please refer to the 
manual for program capabilities and input file requirements.

The submit script is submitted with the `sbatch` command to the
SLURM scheduler. The submit script automatically loads the right
TURBOMOLE module, depending on the chosen number of tasks: 
(a) it selects the SMP version if a user requests more than 1 task
(b) it selects serial version if the number of tasks is 1. 

In the submit script, the lines that start with `#SBATCH` define queue
and job parameters. The TURBOMOLE specific commands must go inside the
`slurm_startjob()` function, where indicated by the comment line.

In the template script example, the main command is a geometry 
optimization calculation via TURBOMOLE’s jobex script assuming
all input files are present in the submit directory.
  
IMPORTANT: Do not call `Config_turbo_env` directly in any of the submit
scripts on HPC3.  Its functionality is replaced by the loading the right
version of TURBOMOLE module in the slurm script.

This template slurm script is designed to exit with error code 1 if
more than one node is requested.  MPI-enabled TURBOMOLE binaries are
not designed to be used with these modules and script.


# MPI template slurm script turbomole7.5_mpi.slurm.template

There is no guarantee that MPI or hybrid OpenMP/MPI will be faster
or more efficient than the equivalent serial or SMP/OpenMP binary.
Also, note that there has been effectively no testing of the 
TURBOMOLE 7.5 MPI-enabled commands on HPC3. 

To prepare a customized slurm script, copy the template 
into a separate file, and edit the file to set the parallelization
level, set queue variables and calls to relevant TURBOMOLE programs.
Please refer to the manual for program parallelization, capabilities 
and input file requirements, and contact the group of Filipp Furche 
(http://ffgroup.chem.uci.edu/) before using MPI.

Some MPI-enabled TURBOMOLE binaries automatically take advantage of
multiple threads per node with hybrid OpenMP/MPI, while others will
not do so - based on which TURBOMOLE programs are going to be called,
setting the environment variable `$TTYPE` will set other environment
variables suitable for either parallelization. $TTYPE in the script
is set to "OMP-MPI", the other option is "MPI". The script will exit
with error code 1 if $TTYPE is not recognized.

In the submit script, the lines that start with `#SBATCH` define queue
and job parameters. The TURBOMOLE specific commands must go inside the
`slurm_startjob()` function, where indicated by the comment line.

In the template script example, the main command is a linear response
calculation in the framework of TDDFT via TURBOMOLE’s escf program
(assuming all input files are present in the submit directory).
  
IMPORTANT: Do not call `Config_turbo_env` directly in any of the submit
scripts on HPC3.  Its functionality is replaced by the loading the right
version of TURBOMOLE module in the slurm script.

# Scratch Disk Usage

The TURBOMOLE manual makes reference to calculations becoming I/O bound
with large file writes and reads. However, most written files are useful
and it is encouraged to submit slurm jobs from the fast network disks 
that are accessible from the login node (eg. /dfs6/pub/<UCInetID>).
 
The exceptions are scratch files on scratch disks which TURBOMOLE
programs and scripts use and that can be set with on of the:
  (1) the keyword `$scratch files` in the `control` file 
  (2) command line options for TURBOMOLE scripts
  (3) exporting the environment variable $TURBOTMPDIR.
Please contact HPC3 at hpc3.support@uci.edu before attempting to use
these options. Do not use `/tmp` for that purpose.
